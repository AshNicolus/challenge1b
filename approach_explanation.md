# üß† Approach Explanation ‚Äì Challenge 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## üë§ Problem Overview

The goal of this challenge is to build an intelligent system that can scan through a set of PDF documents and extract the **most relevant sections** based on a given **persona** (such as a traveler or food lover) and a **specific task** they want to accomplish.

We wanted to create a solution that works across various document formats and languages, captures the structure of content, and ranks it in a way that truly reflects what the persona is looking for.


## üõ†Ô∏è How We Approached It

### 1. **Understanding the Document Structure**

We started by analyzing the structure of each PDF to break it down into meaningful sections. Using **PyMuPDF**, we looked at visual cues like:

* Font sizes
* Bold text
* Position of text on the page

This helped us detect titles and headings‚Äîeven in PDFs without clear formatting. Each heading becomes the start of a new section, and we grab the paragraphs that follow it.

### 2. **Speeding Things Up with Parallel Processing**

Since there could be many PDFs in a collection, we used **parallel processing** to handle them faster. By using **Python's asyncio** along with thread pools, we extract sections from multiple PDFs at the same time. This significantly reduces the total processing time without compromising accuracy.


### 3. **Understanding Relevance Using AI**

Once we had all the sections, we needed a smart way to figure out which ones matched the user‚Äôs intent.

We used a **sentence embedding model** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to convert both the section content and the persona‚Äôs task into numerical vectors. Then, we calculated the **semantic similarity** between them. This way, we weren‚Äôt just looking for keyword matches, but for actual meaning.

So, even if a document didn‚Äôt use the same words as the task, it could still rank high if it discussed similar ideas.


### 4. **Organizing with Dynamic Categories**

Instead of using fixed categories, we dynamically generated categories by picking the most common keywords from the section titles. Then, we compared those with keywords from the persona‚Äôs job description to prioritize which themes mattered most.

This makes the system adaptable ‚Äî it learns from the documents and the user‚Äôs context.


### 5. **Picking the Best Content**

Finally, we selected the **top sections** based on similarity scores, while making sure:

* We didn‚Äôt take too many from one document
* We included a variety of relevant topics

Each chosen section is also summarized for quick reading.


Our system brings together structure detection, semantic understanding, and performance optimization to deliver highly relevant results tailored to the user. It mimics how a person would skim through a guide or brochure, quickly finding what‚Äôs most useful to them ‚Äî and does it in seconds.
